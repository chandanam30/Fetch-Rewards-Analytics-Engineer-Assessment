Fetch-Rewards-Analytics-Engineer-Assessment

This repository shows how to create and utilise a dimensional model for a data warehouse. Below is a description of every file that is part of the repository:

1. Part -1 RelationalDataModel.docx and Dimension Model.png: This document contains the diagram for the data model and explanations related to the schema. The diagram was created using an online diagramming tool called LucidChart.

2. FetchRewardsTake_HomeTest.ipynb: This notebook focuses on part 2 and 3 of the exercise. I used Python and its built-in libraries for parsing JSON and processing the dataframes and SQLite as the SQL Dialect for running the queries. I also evaluated the data for quality issues and found 2 main problems, the dataset has many null values, and secondly, almost half the records in the user's file are duplicated. links for downloading and installing jupyter notebook and SQLite are given below along with references.

3. rewards_db.db: A database file containing relational tables(Question 1-SQLITE.png and Question 2-SQLITE.png).

4. stakeholder_email.docx: A brief summary of my findings articulated in an e-mail message.
